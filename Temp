Program Overview

Migration executed in two parallel activities:

Claims Migration: Wawanesa AWS Cloud → Guidewire Cloud

Document Migration: Wawanesa AWS Cloud (S3) → FileNet On-Prem

Total Scope:

1.3M Claims

~23M Documents

~50 TB Content

Phase-wise Execution Plan

Phase 1 (Pilot – Feb 13):

25,000 closed claims (0–3 years)

Phase 2:

Open claims: ~6,000 claims / ~678K documents

Phase 3:

Remaining closed claims (0–3 years): ~200K claims / ~6.5M documents

Scale-up dependent on pilot success & business sign-off

Operational Model

Claims migrated first by ClaimCenter team

Migrated claims shared daily with Document Migration team

Associated documents ingested into FileNet On-Prem

Target throughput: ~500K documents/day (subscription-controlled ingestion)

Environment Overview

UAT: 8 CPU | 32 GB RAM

Production: 16 CPU | 64 GB RAM

Key Risks & Open Issues

Significant performance gap observed:

UAT: 100K documents in ~30 minutes

Production: 100K documents in ~6.5 hours

Important clarification:

All document content and metadata are already received from Wawanesa

Content is downloaded and stored locally on the FileNet migration server

Migration reads content from local storage only and pushes to FileNet batch-by-batch

No remote content fetch or external network dependency involved

Despite identical migration logic and local content access, production performance is drastically slower

Requires urgent investigation (FileNet configuration, subscriptions, DB, storage I/O, infra, network latency)
