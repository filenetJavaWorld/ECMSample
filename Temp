Project Overview

The project involves two parallel activities: Claims migration from Wawanesa AWS Cloud to Guidewire Cloud, and document migration into FileNet

Total scope includes approximately 1.3 million claims, 23 million documents, and 50 TB of content

Claims are migrated first by the ClaimCenter team and then handed over to the Document Migration team for FileNet ingestion

All document content and metadata were already received from Wawanesa, downloaded, and stored locally on the migration server

During migration, documents are read from local storage and pushed batch-by-batch into the FileNet repository, with no remote content dependency

2. Phase-Wise Migration Plan

Phase 1 (Pilot – Feb 13): 25,000 closed claims (0–3 years) from an overall pool of ~200,000 closed claims

Phase 2: Open claims migration covering ~6,000 claims and ~678K documents, post business sign-off

Phase 3: Remaining closed claims (0–3 years), approximately 200,000 claims and ~6.5 million documents

Daily operational model includes ClaimCenter sharing migrated claims with the Document Migration team for FileNet processing

3. Throughput & Environment Details

Target ingestion rate is ~500K documents per day, controlled due to FileNet subscriptions

UAT environment: 8 CPU cores and 32 GB RAM

Production environment: 16 CPU cores and 64 GB RAM

Observed performance difference: UAT processes 100K documents in ~30 minutes, while Pre-Prod/Production takes ~6.5 hours for the same volume

4. Key Performance Concern

Significant performance degradation observed in Pre-Prod/Production compared to UAT

Since content is accessed locally in both environments, the performance gap is not related to network or remote storage

Further investigation is required across FileNet configuration, subscriptions, database performance, storage I/O, and infrastructure

5. ECM Team – Roles & Responsibilities (Production Support)

Monitor FileNet production environment health and ensure overall system stability during document migration runs

Monitor production storage capacity, including object store and content storage utilization

Support FileNet availability and restore services promptly in case of system outages

Investigate FileNet performance issues, including document commit delays and database-level slowness

Monitor FileNet subscriptions, event queues, and backlogs to avoid throttling or heap pressure

Review and adjust subscription and queue threshold configurations based on ingestion throughput

Implement and validate object model, property, and configuration changes in production aligned with UAT

Provide proactive support during high-volume migration windows in coordination with the migration team

6. Additional Discussion – UAT vs Pre-Prod Performance Testing

Discussed why document ingestion is slower in Pre-Prod compared to UAT

Rameshwari to conduct additional ingestion tests in UAT using larger file sizes (5 MB and 10 MB)

Results will be compared with Pre-Prod/Staging to understand file-size impact on performance

7. Additional Discussion – Performance Tuning (Threads & Instances)

Mahendra suggested increasing the number of processing threads and scaling the number of application instances

Rameshwari is working on increasing thread counts and instance capacity to evaluate performance improvements

Objective is to validate whether the tuning helps achieve the target throughput of ~500K documents per day

8. Additional Discussion – Document Security Issue in Pre-Prod

Users were unable to view documents in Pre-Prod due to missing user-specific security groups

Root cause identified as FileNet subscriptions being disabled in Pre-Prod, preventing security group assignment

ECM team suggested triggering subscriptions by updating a business property (Amount = 0.0) on affected documents

Rameshwari initiated a Content Engine API–based script to update documents and force subscription execution

Scope includes 5,220 claims, approximately 554K documents

Processing is running from a local server and facing intermittent network disconnections

As of now, 800 claims have been processed, with remaining claims being handled by the offshore team

Once complete, document security is expected to be corrected and users should regain access, with a consolidated progress update to be shared
