Hello Team,

As discussed, we completed multiple benchmark runs for the FileNet migration utility using different content sizes and thread configurations. Based on the actual execution logs and observed throughput, we have prepared a detailed time-to-complete estimate for migrating up to **500,000 documents**, categorized by **file size** and **number of threads**.

All tests were executed with:

* Batch size: 100
* Success rate: 100%
* Same environment (Content Engine, database, storage, and network)

The results below reflect **measured throughput for 5 threads** and **realistic scaling projections** for higher thread counts, considering typical FileNet CE, database, and storage constraints.

### 1 MB Content Files – Estimated Time for 500,000 Documents

|    Threads | Estimated Time      |
| ---------: | ------------------- |
|  5 threads | ~3 hours 21 minutes |
| 10 threads | ~2 hours 09 minutes |
| 15 threads | ~1 hour 39 minutes  |
| 20 threads | ~1 hour 23 minutes  |

### 2 MB Content Files – Estimated Time for 500,000 Documents

|    Threads | Estimated Time      |
| ---------: | ------------------- |
|  5 threads | ~4 hours 45 minutes |
| 10 threads | ~3 hours 02 minutes |
| 15 threads | ~2 hours 20 minutes |
| 20 threads | ~1 hour 57 minutes  |

### 4 MB Content Files – Estimated Time for 500,000 Documents

|    Threads | Estimated Time      |
| ---------: | ------------------- |
|  5 threads | ~6 hours 44 minutes |
| 10 threads | ~4 hours 19 minutes |
| 15 threads | ~3 hours 19 minutes |
| 20 threads | ~2 hours 46 minutes |

### 9 MB Content Files (Worst Case) – Estimated Time for 500,000 Documents

|    Threads | Estimated Time       |
| ---------: | -------------------- |
|  5 threads | ~11 hours 41 minutes |
| 10 threads | ~7 hours 29 minutes  |
| 15 threads | ~5 hours 46 minutes  |
| 20 threads | ~4 hours 48 minutes  |

### Key Observations

* Migration performance is strongly influenced by **content size**.
* Increasing threads improves throughput, but scaling is **not linear** due to Content Engine I/O, database activity, and storage limits.
* Noticeable diminishing returns begin beyond **10–15 threads**.
* Even for large (9 MB) documents, **500K documents can be migrated within a single working day** with appropriate threading.

---

### Recommendation

Based on stability, throughput, and resource utilization, we recommend:

* **10 to 15 threads** as the optimal configuration for sustained migrations.
* Higher thread counts (20+) should be used only after confirming CE JVM heap sizing, database connection pool limits, and storage IOPS capacity.
