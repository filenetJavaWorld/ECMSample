I've completed the technical assessment for the multi-repository search feature requirement.
Requirement
Develop an ICN plugin feature that searches across multiple configured repositories simultaneously (e.g., repo1 & repo2) based on user input (account number), queries configured document classes, and displays aggregated results.
Feasibility: ✅ Yes, Technically Feasible
The solution will include:
Backend REST service for parallel multi-repo queries
Admin configuration UI for repository/class/property mappings
Search interface with aggregated results grid
Standard ICN document actions (View, Download, Properties)
Timeline: 3-4 weeks
Backend development: 5-7 days
Configuration layer: 3-4 days
Frontend UI: 4-5 days
Testing & deployment: 4-6 days
Key Points
✅ Aggregates results from multiple repositories
✅ ICN document actions work seamlessly
✅ Respects user permissions per repository
⚠️ Results display common properties; class-specific details shown on-demand
Ready to proceed with development once approved.
